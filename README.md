# clustering-algorithm
raw code for k-means clustering
data input must of the type 2d dimensional array
the stopping condition is activated the total sum of distance between the new cluster centers and old cluster centers is less than epsilon
    - cluster centers are stabilised (the cumulative sum is 0 or less than some limit = epsilon) 
The output is the the cluster centers, and classes of the data points
